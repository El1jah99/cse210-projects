##Welcome to StudyRight!

This program allows you to create and study your own flashcards and quizzes. 

When you start the program, you will see the following menu:

####What would you like to do?
#####1. Study Flashcards
#####2. Take Quiz
#####3. Create or edit a studyset
#####4. Create or edit a quiz
#####5. Delete a studyset
#####6. Delete a quiz
#####7. Quit

If you want to test out the program, you can type 1 or 2 to practice with one of the built-in studysets (flashcards) or quizzes. 

Otherwise, you can type 3 or 4 to create your own studyset or quiz. This option will prompt you to type the name of the subject you wish to study, and will open an existing file or create a new .txt file with the name of that subject. You can then input your studyset or quiz.

######Pro tip: If a studyset or quiz already exists with the name you type in, that file will open. You can either edit the existing file, or close it and create a new file with a different name. 

When creating a studyset or quiz, you must follow a specific format or the program will not function properly. 

Each line of the .txt file must be formatted as follows:

####For Flashcards:

#####Question|Answer

####For Quizzes:

#####Question|Answer1|Answer2|Answer3|Answer4|Correct answer number (1-4)


######Note: you must provide four answer choices. You may leave some blank, but you still must type the || characters. No more than four choices may be used.


By selecting 5 or 6, you may select and delete existing studysets or quizzes. 


Typing 7 or any invalid input will cause you to exit the program.
